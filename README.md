# sqlalchemy-challenge
* Module 10 was focussed on sqlalchemy-challenge to help us erenfoce what we have learned regarding use SQLAlchemy to create calsses that model tables, perform database perations, reflcet existing databases, and use inpector function to see DB information.

# The first part of the assignemt is to Analyze and Explore the Climate Data using jupyter notebook in python diffrent fuctions.
* Example of DataFrame from Exploratory Precipitation Analysis

* It looks like the highest amout of percipitation is in August and April

* Example of frequecy histogram of 12 months of temperature observation data for this station

# The 2nd part of the module challenge was to practice designing of our own climate App
* For this task I worte the script in VSB text editor folowing the activity examples we had during our class. the activities include set up import functions, databse steup, falsk steup and flask routes.

*Then I run the code Using terminal and Python that resultsed in a link that product the output of the cliate app.

* copying and pasting the diffrent routes to the main lik, you get see the diffrent outputs you can see below
